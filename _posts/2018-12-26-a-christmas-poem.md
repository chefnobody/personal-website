There comes a time in every life,  
When things you have do not suffice.

To meet your need and want for more,  
And satisfy your heart's great chore.

The thought arrives a thief at night,  
Cleaves heart and soul from their delight.

You've known it true but failed to see,  
How great a power this could be.

With darkened soul you have become,  
An ashen heart so lifeless, numb.

...

There's hope for you, do not despair,  
A longing fulfilled; Your deepest care.

A tree with lights brings gifts for flesh,  
The Tree of Life wrings life from death.
