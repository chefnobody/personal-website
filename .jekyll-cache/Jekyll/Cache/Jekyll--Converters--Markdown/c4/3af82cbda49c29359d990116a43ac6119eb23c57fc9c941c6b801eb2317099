I"Ê<p>Occasionally I will receive email from recruiters about â€œcanâ€™t-missâ€ opportunities. The notes often feel like auto-generated spam, with my personal information copied and pasted into place.</p>

<h3 id="perspective-a">Perspective A</h3>

<p>On one hand this seems contrived and impersonal. I mean, if this is such a really â€œamazing opportunity at a Series A start-upâ€ <em>and</em> you think Iâ€™d be â€œthe perfect candidate,â€ couldnâ€™t you have taken time to write me something personal? If these assuptions are true, reacting this way could be justified.</p>

<p>On the other hand, however, should I not be grateful that job opportunities are <em>coming to me</em> rather than me having to find them? Should I not be thankful that someone thought to send me an email (regardless of the method) and thought (perhaps for only a moment) that I might a fit for a position they know about?</p>

<h3 id="what-if">What If?</h3>

<p>What if recruiters <em>never</em> emailed you with opportunities? What if you had to constantly hunt for your next opportunity? What if you never left your crummy job because you werenâ€™t sure what other opportunities were available?</p>
