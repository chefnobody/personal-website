I"‡<p>There comes a time in every life,<br />
When things you have do not suffice.</p>

<p>To meet your need and want for more,<br />
And satisfy your heartâ€™s great chore.</p>

<p>The thought arrives a thief at night,<br />
Cleaves heart and soul from their delight.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve known it true but failed to see,<br />
How great a power this could be.</p>

<p>With darkened soul you have become,<br />
An ashen heart so lifeless, numb.</p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s hope for you, do not despair,<br />
A longing fulfilled; Your deepest care.</p>

<p>A tree with lights brings gifts for flesh,<br />
The Tree of Life wrings life from death.</p>
