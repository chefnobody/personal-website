<p><em>Stumble with me through React, a web browser and the fuzzy grey area between.</em></p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Recently, I decided to read through all of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">React documentation</a> to better understand the framework and to try and pick up things I might have missed. Though I had worked with React a bit, I had not ventured into the documentation until I needed to know something specific. In hindsight, I wish I read through them sooner because they are fantastic.</p>

<p>When I came to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html">Refs and the DOM</a> I wondered why anyone would need this functionality. React Components are an abstraction of the native DOM elements that your browser renders along with their attributes and various functions. React has a normal “data flow” thorugh these components managed by <code class="highlighter-rouge">props</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">state</code> and so it seemed that with them you could drive the values of any property on any <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTMLElement</code> about and get the behavior you want.</p>

<h4 id="the-confusion">The Confusion</h4>

<p>Check out the methods for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement#Methods"><code class="highlighter-rouge">HTMLElement</code></a>. This means, that in the example from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html">Refs and the DOM</a> an <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTMLElement</code> does not have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">focused</code> property, rather it has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.focus()</code> function. You can’t easily use <code class="highlighter-rouge">props</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">state</code> or the view lifecycle to manipulate a custom <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> Component to auto-focus. In React, it is useful to have a reference to this DOM element so that you can call <code class="highlighter-rouge">.focus()</code> on it. I think this is what is meant by an “escape hatch”.</p>
